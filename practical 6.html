    <p>Maharana Pratap, born in 1540, was the valiant king of Mewar, renowned for his unwavering resistance against Mughal Emperor Akbar. He ascended the throne in 1572, inheriting a kingdom under threat. His legendary bravery shone in the Battle of Haldighati in 1576, where he led a fierce, though ultimately tactically difficult, fight. He refused to surrender, enduring years of hardship to defend his homeland's independence. His dedication to freedom and his military prowess cemented his place as a symbol of Rajput valor. He died in 1597, leaving a legacy of courage.<p></p>
